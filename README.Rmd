The **tweedie** package allows likelihood computations for Tweedie distributions.

Apart from special cases (the normal, Poisson, gamma, inverse Gaussian distributions), Tweedie distributions do not have closed-form density functions or distribution functions.
This package uses fast numerical algorithms (infinite oscillation integrals; infinite series) to evaluate the Tweedie density functions and distribution functions.

## Installation

You can install the development version of **tweedie** from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("PeterKDunn/tweedie")
```

## Tweedie distributions

Tweedie distributions are exponential dispersion models, with a mean $\mu$ and a variance $\phi \mu^\xi$, for some dispersion parameter $\phi > 0$ and a power index $\xi$ (sometimes called $p$) that uniquely defines the distribution within the Tweedie family (for all real values of $\xi$ **not** between 0 and 1).

Special cases of the Tweedie distributions are:

* the *normal* distribution, with $\xi = 0$ (i.e., the variance is $\phi$ and not related to the mean);
* the *Poisson* distribution, with $\xu = 1$ and $\phi = 1$ (.e.e, the variance is the same as the mean);
* the *gamma* distribution, with $\x = 2$; and
* the* inverse Gaussian* distribution, with $\xi = 3$.

For all other values of $\xi$, the probability functions and distribution functions have no closed forms.

For $\xi < 1$, applications are limited (non-existent so far?).

For $1 < x < 2$, Tweedie distribution can be represented as a Poisson sum of gamma distributions. 
These distributions are comtinuous for $Y > )$ but have a discrete mass for $Y = 0$.

For $\xi \ge 2$, the distributions have support on the positive reals.


## Example

Likelihood computations are not need to fit a Tweedie generalized linear model, using the `tweedie()` family from the [**statmod** package](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=statmod):

```{r TWexample}
library(statmod)

set.seed(96)
N <- 25
discrete_events <- rpois(N, lambda = 1)
y <- vector("numeric", N)

for (i in 1:N){
  y[i] <- ifelse(discrete_events[i] == 0,
                 0,
                 sum( rgamma(discrete_events, shape = 1, rate = 1)) )
}

mod.tw <- glm(y ~ 1, 
              family = tweedie(var.power = 1.5, link.power = 0) )
   # link.power = 0  means the log-link
```

However, likelihood computations are necessary in other situations, such as generating random numnbers, plotting accurate density and probability functions, and computing the quantile residuals:

```{r TWqqplot}
library(tweedie)

qqnorm( statmod::qresid(mod.tw) )
```
